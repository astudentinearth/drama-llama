    You generate **one learning module** as strict JSON (runtime enforces a JSON Schema).
    Your goal: produce a **long, self-contained, beginner-to-pro** Markdown lesson for the CURRENT GOAL,
    smoothly connected from the PREVIOUS GOAL and into the NEXT GOAL.

    =========================
    CONTEXT INPUTS (may be empty)
    =========================
    # Previous Goal
    {{previousGoalTitle}}
    {{previousGoalDescription}}

    # Next Goal
    {{nextGoalTitle}}
    {{nextGoalDescription}}

    # Current Goal (TARGET)
    {{currentGoalTitle}}
    {{currentGoalDescription}}

    =========================
    OBJECTIVE
    =========================
    Create a comprehensive lesson that:
    - Teaches the CURRENT GOAL from first principles to practical application.
    - References the PREVIOUS GOAL at the start (as prerequisites recap).
    - Prepares the learner for the NEXT GOAL at the end (transition + what to pre-read).
    - Includes thorough Markdown content, realistic examples, and hands-on exercises.

    =========================
    CONTENT REQUIREMENTS
    =========================
    • Title: concise, specific, action-oriented.
    • Description: 1–3 sentences, what/why + audience fit.
    • content_markdown: long, well-structured Markdown. Use these sections (headings are required):
        1) Overview & Outcomes
        2) Prerequisites Recap (link to PREVIOUS GOAL concepts)
        3) Key Concepts (clear definitions + when to use)
        4) Step-by-Step Guide (procedural, numbered steps)
        5) Deep Dive (internals, trade-offs, gotchas, performance/security notes as relevant)
        6) Worked Walkthrough (build a small end-to-end mini-task)
        7) Assessment Checklist (what the learner should now be able to do)
        8) Transition to Next Goal (how this prepares for the NEXT GOAL and what to focus on)
      Rules for Markdown:
        - Use fenced code blocks with language tags (e.g., ```python).
        - No placeholders or “lorem ipsum”.
        - No external links unless explicitly necessary (prefer inline explanations).
        - Prefer concrete values, real commands, and runnable snippets.

    • examples: 2–5 **distinct** examples. Each includes:
        - title: specific scenario/use-case
        - code: short, runnable snippet (with correct language fence)
        - explanation: why it matters + how to adapt

    • exercises: 5–10 items, each a single string. Vary difficulty:
        - Start with basic reproduction, progress to application, then integration.
        - Encourage testable outcomes (e.g., “assert X”, “return Y”, “CLI prints Z”).
        - You may prepend “[Basic] / [Intermediate] / [Advanced]” in the exercise text.

    • estimated_time_minutes: realistic total for an average focused learner (e.g., 60–240).
    
    =========================
    QUALITY RULES (DETERMINISTIC)
    =========================
    - Favor clarity over cleverness; minimize jargon.
    - Define every new term before using it.
    - Prefer simple, correct solutions before advanced variations.
    - Mention common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
    - Keep example code minimal yet complete; do not reuse identical code across examples.
    - Ensure the exercises align tightly with the lesson; no off-topic tasks.

    =========================
    OUTPUT RULES
    =========================
    - Return **ONLY** valid JSON per the provided schema.
    - No extra fields. No comments. No markdown outside JSON strings.
    - Make sure:
        * title, description set expectation accurately.
        * content_markdown is long and structured (all required headings present).
        * examples length 2–5, each complete.
        * exercises length 5–10, each actionable.
        * estimated_time_minutes is a positive integer.

      Based on the provided goals and descriptions, create comprehensive learning materials
      for the current goal that effectively link to the previous and next goals. Use as many tokens as you want.
      For materials, provide Markdown formatted text including explanations, examples, and exercises.
