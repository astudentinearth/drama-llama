# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive API layer for the Drama Llama application, providing TypeScript interfaces and functions for Jobs, Company, User Profile, and Upload endpoints. The implementation follows existing patterns established in the auth API and provides type-safe access to all backend services.

## Glossary

- **API_Layer**: The TypeScript abstraction layer that provides functions and types for interacting with backend endpoints
- **Drama_Llama_App**: The frontend React application that consumes the API layer
- **Backend_Service**: The server-side application that provides REST endpoints
- **Type_Definitions**: TypeScript interfaces that define the structure of API request and response data
- **API_Functions**: TypeScript functions that handle HTTP requests to specific endpoints
- **Error_Handling**: Consistent error management across all API calls using existing patterns

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type-safe API functions for job management, so that I can interact with job listings without runtime type errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer calls getJobs(), THE API_Layer SHALL return a typed JobListingsResponse
2. WHEN a developer calls getJobById() with a valid ID, THE API_Layer SHALL return a typed JobListing
3. WHEN a developer calls createJob() with valid data, THE API_Layer SHALL return a typed JobListing with generated ID
4. WHEN a developer calls updateJob() with valid data, THE API_Layer SHALL return the updated JobListing
5. IF an API call fails, THEN THE API_Layer SHALL throw a descriptive error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type-safe API functions for job applications, so that I can manage applications with proper type checking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer calls createJobApplication() with valid data, THE API_Layer SHALL return a typed JobApplication
2. WHEN a developer calls getJobApplications() with a job ID, THE API_Layer SHALL return a typed JobApplicationsResponse
3. WHEN a developer calls getApplicationsCount() with a job ID, THE API_Layer SHALL return a typed ApplicationsCount
4. THE API_Layer SHALL validate that jobId parameters are provided for application endpoints
5. IF application creation fails, THEN THE API_Layer SHALL throw a descriptive error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type-safe API functions for user profiles, so that I can manage user data with compile-time type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer calls getUserProfile() with a user ID, THE API_Layer SHALL return a typed UserProfileResponse
2. WHEN a developer calls updateUserProfile() with valid data, THE API_Layer SHALL return the updated UserProfileResponse
3. WHEN a developer calls getUserCVs() with a user ID, THE API_Layer SHALL return a typed GetCVsResponse
4. THE API_Layer SHALL validate that userId parameters are provided for profile endpoints
5. IF profile operations fail, THEN THE API_Layer SHALL throw a descriptive error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type-safe API functions for company and file upload operations, so that I can handle these operations with proper error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer calls createCompany(), THE API_Layer SHALL return a string company ID
2. WHEN a developer calls uploadCV() with a file, THE API_Layer SHALL return a typed UploadCvResponse
3. THE API_Layer SHALL handle FormData for file uploads properly
4. THE API_Layer SHALL use consistent error handling patterns across all endpoints
5. IF upload operations fail, THEN THE API_Layer SHALL throw a descriptive error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all API functions to follow consistent patterns, so that the codebase remains maintainable and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API_Layer SHALL use the existing success() function for response validation
2. THE API_Layer SHALL use axios for all HTTP requests
3. THE API_Layer SHALL define TypeScript interfaces for all request and response types
4. THE API_Layer SHALL organize functions into logical feature-based modules
5. THE API_Layer SHALL follow the same naming conventions as the existing auth API
